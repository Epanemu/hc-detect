# HumanCompatible - Detect

[![Docs](https://readthedocs.org/projects/humancompatible-detect/badge/?version=latest)](https://humancompatible-detect.readthedocs.io/en/latest)

A library of methods for detecting Bias (lack of Fairness) in AI models (or datasets).

## AI Fairness

In a fairness auditing, one would generally like to know if two distributions are identical.
These distributions could be a distribution of internal private training data and publicly accessible data from a nation-wide census, i.e., a good baseline.
Or one can compare samples classified positively and negatively, to see if groups are represented equally in each class.

In other words, we ask

> Is there *some* combination of protected attributes (race √ó age √ó ‚Ä¶) for which people are treated noticeably differently?

Samples belonging to a given combination of protected attributes is called a subgroup.
<!-- Formally, let

* **X** ‚àà ‚Ñù<sup>d</sup> be the feature space,
* **P** and **Q** two distributions we want to compare (e.g. training vs census, positives vs negatives),
* **ùí´** ‚äÇ {1,‚Ä¶,d} the indices of *protected* features (age, sex, race, ‚Ä¶).

A **sub-group** *S* is all samples whose protected attributes take one fixed value each.
We must consider every such intersection ‚Äì their number is exponential in |ùí´|.
 -->

## Using HumanCompatible.Detect

1) Install the library:
    ```bash
    python -m pip install git+https://github.com/humancompatible/detect.git
    ```
2) Compute the bias:
    ```python
    from humancompatible.detect.MSD import compute_MSD

    # toy example
    # (col 1 = Race, col 2 = Age, col 3 = (binary) target)
    msd, rule_idx = compute_MSD(
        csv_path = csv,
        target = "Target",
        protected_list = ["Race", "Age"],
    )
    ```

### More to explore
- `examples/01_usage.ipynb` ‚Äì a 5-minute notebook reproducing the call above,
then translating `rule_idx` back to human-readable conditions.

Feel free to start with the light notebook, then dive into the experiments with different datasets.

We also provide [documentation](https://humancompatible-detect.readthedocs.io/en/latest/detect.MSD.html). For more details on installation, see [Installation details](#installation-details).

## Methods

### Maximum Subgroup Discrepancy (MSD)

MSD is the subgroup maximal difference in probability mass of a given subgroup, comparing the mass given by each distribution.

</div>

<!-- ```math

\text{MSD}(P,Q;\,ùí´)=
\max_{S\;\text{sub-group on }ùí´}\;
\bigl|\;P(S)-Q(S)\;\bigr|.

``` -->

* Naturally, two distributions are *fair* iff all sub-groups have similar mass.
* The **arg max** immediately tells you *which* group is most disadvantaged as an interpretable attribute-value combination.
* MSD has linear sample complexity, a stark contrast to exponential complexity of other distributional distances (Wasserstein, TV...)

## Installation details

### Requirements
- **Python ‚â• 3.10**

- **A MILP solver** (to solve the mixed-integer program)
  * Gurobi 10.x is auto-detected if present - free academic licences are available.


### (Optional) create a fresh environment
```bash
python -m venv .venv
# ‚îÄ‚îÄ Activate it ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ
# Linux / macOS
source .venv/bin/activate
# Windows ‚Äì cmd.exe
.venv\Scripts\activate.bat
# Windows ‚Äì PowerShell
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

### Install the package

> Before we complete the PyPI release you can install the latest snapshot straight from GitHub in one line:

```bash
python -m pip install git+https://github.com/humancompatible/detect.git
```

If you prefer an editable (developer) install:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/humancompatible/detect.git
cd detect
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m pip install -e .
```

### Verify it worked
```bash
python -c "from humancompatible.detect.MSD import compute_MSD; print('MSD imported OK')"
```

If the import fails you‚Äôll see: <br>
`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'humancompatible'`.

## Why classical distances fail

| Distance | Needs to look at | Worst-case samples | Drawback |
|----------|-----------------|--------------------|----------|
| Wasserstein, Total Variation, MMD, ‚Ä¶ | full *d*-dimensional joint | Œ©(2<sup>d</sup>) | exponential sample cost, no group explanation |
| **MSD (ours)** | only the protected marginal | **O(d)** | exact group, human-readable |

MSD‚Äôs linear sample complexity is proven in the paper and achieved in practice via an **exact Mixed-Integer Optimisation** that scans the doubly-exponential search space implicitly, returning **both** the metric value and the rule that realises it.
